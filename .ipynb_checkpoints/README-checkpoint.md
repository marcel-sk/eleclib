# Purpose
To create a python utility to simplify electrical and off-grid load calculations.\
Currently only the household load calculator is functional- see Module household

### This will eventually include:
* conductor sizing
* household load calculation
* solar, wind, and hydro considerations
* battery sizing
* pricing
* ... unfinished list ...

# Module household
You can create a Household object in order to call various accessors and reporter methods which for now only returns the total electrical load
## Getting Started
There are three ways to create a Household object:
1. You can create a new Household object programatically by supplying all or most inputs. The rest of the inputs will remain at their default values which should resemble average or typical values.
2. You can set prompt=True and follow the terminal prompts to set it up:

>from electriclib.household import Household\
>myHouse = Household(prompt=True)

3. You can load in an excel file as generated by the Household.report() method in a previous session.

>myHouse.report("report.xlsx")\
>newHouse = Household(file_source = "./report.xlsx")

### Household(self,**kwargs):

| param | default | description |
| :--- | :--- | :---
|prompt|False|If True construct the Household through interactive command prompts
|file_source | None | String- location of a generated report file from which to gather parameters
|square_footage|6000|Int- total household square footage
|heating_type|"gas"|String- ["gas","wood","baseboard-electric","geo-electric","infloor-electric","none"]
|water_heater_type|"gas"|String- ["gas","electric","none"]
|oven_type|"gas"|String- ["gas", "electric-full", "electric-toaster", "none"]
|oven_wattage|0|INT- 1000 to 5000
|fridge_type|"electric"|String- ["electric", "electic-low-volt", "propane", "propane-electric"]
|fridge_wattage|400|INT- 50 to 5000 in Kwh/year of usage
|light_bulbs|"LED"|String- ["LED", "halogen", "incandescent"]
|R_roof|30|INT- 0 to 100 Average R-value of the roof default is from building code for Ontario as of 2021
|R_walls|24|INT- 0 to 100 Average R-value of the walls. default is from building code for Ontario as of 2021
|off_grid| False | Bool- is the house off-grid in the sense of not being connected to a municipal power grid.
|occupants|3|Int- 0 to 100. Number of permanent occupants. Used to determine water usage, lighting, etc.

## Public Methods:

### get_peak_current():
Returns the peak current in Amps. This is often needed in sizing panels, main lines, and ogg grid components like batteries and fuses.

### get_power_usage():
Returns power usage in Killowatt hours. You can use this with peak=True and timespan=1, to get the peak daily value which is a useful number in calculating off grid requirements like battery capacity and power production from solar, wind, or hydro.

>myHouse.get_power_usage(1, peak=True)

| Inputs | Default | Required | Description
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| timespan | 1 | True | Int- number of days. Defaults to a daily power usage (1) but can be set  to 30 to get monthly (typical billing cycle) or 365 for yearly power usage.
| peak | False | False | Bool- wether to give us the peak value (True) or the average. Default is the average. 

### get_recommendations():
Returns recommendations for reducing power consumption. It can suggest things like switching an appliance to 12V from 120V if it is more efficient (off-grid fridge).

### report():
Generates a report so that the info can be used and viewed later. Supports only the xlsx format at the moment.

| Inputs | Default | Required | Description
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| file_path | "./report.xlsx" | True | String- File path for the generated report. Only supports xlsx at the moment.
